## Project Structure

### React Context Controller Pattern

This project implements the React Context Controller pattern, an architectural approach for managing state and data flow in React applications.
For reference, see:

- [Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEUI-Kvsycs)
- [Article: Context Controller Pattern in React](https://medium.com/@diegoguevaraco/context-controller-pattern-in-react-399bfedfe55e)

Overview

Similar to the Model–View–Controller (MVC) paradigm, the Context serves as the Controller, responsible for managing state and exposing data and actions to the component (View) tree.

By centralizing control logic within Context providers, this pattern:

- Eliminates prop drilling across deeply nested components.
- Promotes self-contained and maintainable view modules.
- Improves scalability by decoupling state management from presentation logic.
